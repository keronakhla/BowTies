# BowTies
Bow Ties is a lightweight bow tie management application. Tapping on a particular color pulls up an image of the tie and populates several labels on the screen with specific information about the tie. This includes: name of tie, number of times worn, data last wore, and whether the tie is a favorite of the user.
